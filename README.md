# FlappyBirdCloneOne

This game was made only for academic proposal. I don't have any right over the assets used.
All the assets I used in this project was from Code Monkey's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Wpni9KPik) and a [repo](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets) I found on GitHub.

Feel free to clone and play around with the project. You can also play the game [here](https://gigamax13.itch.io/flappybirdmobile).
